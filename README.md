# mega4_reram
Entry for MPW 8 of Open MPW funded by Google

## Objectives
1) To characterise ReRAM cells under different shapes / sizes

## Top Level Overview
* Almost an exact replica of [this repository](https://github.com/andreamifsud/mega4_rram_nom) except the gds. Refer to the repo for more details about actual circuit. 
* ReRAM cells in this design have the following features:
	* Various shapes; square, rectange, hexagonal, circle
	* Various sizes / aspect ratios (min 0.32um, max 1.25um)
	* They violate a number of ReRAM drc rules which will be waived at own risk if design is accepted, and allowed by foundry
